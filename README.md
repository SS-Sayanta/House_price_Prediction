# 🏠 House Price Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to build a regression model that can estimate house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors.

## 📌 Project Overview

House price prediction is a classic supervised machine learning problem. In this project, we:

* Analyze a housing dataset
* Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Train machine learning regression models
* Evaluate model performance
* Make predictions on unseen data

This project is suitable for **beginners to intermediate learners** in Data Science and Machine Learning.

## 📊 Model Output

* The model predicts house prices based on input features
* Evaluation metrics are used to check accuracy and performance

---

## ✅ Results

The trained model provides reasonably accurate predictions and demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world regression problems like real estate price estimation.
